Hajoon visited Bruce Cornuelle and Art Miller at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in February, 2020.
The main purpose of the visit is to set up the WRF-MITgcm coupled model over the northwest Pacific.
It was good to be back and meet amazing people there.


This visit was possible through the support from Korea Research Foundation (신진연구).
